## Project Narrative

### The Challenge
The company's existing customer-facing chatbot had a poorly performing Speech-to-Text (STT) feature, leading to user frustration. My primary goal was to research and implement a superior solution.

### Phase 1: Research & Development Prototype (`01-ai-chatbot-prototype`)
To demonstrate the art of the possible, I first built a full-stack AI chatbot prototype. This project served as a proof-of-concept to validate modern AI tools and showcase a significantly better user experience. It features a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) backend and a fully voice-enabled UI.

### Phase 2: Production-Ready Microservice (`02-whisper-stt-service`)
Following the success of the prototype, I was tasked with engineering the STT component into a professional, standalone service that could be integrated into the company's main application. This involved refactoring the prototype's STT logic into a robust, documented, and scalable REST API using FastAPI.

This journey demonstrates my ability to not only prototype innovative AI solutions but also to understand and build production-level software.
